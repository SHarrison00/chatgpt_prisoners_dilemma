## Project Description

UCL Module Project: Statistical Design of Investigations (STAT0029)

Date: February 2023

**Summary:** In this repository, you will find code used to implement an experiment involving human participants playing (Iterated) Prisoner's Dilemma with a computer that is anthropomorphized at different levels. Specifically, most of the code here was used for implemention of experiment (game) *interface*. The overall aim of the experiment was to investigate **how cooperation between players and the computer would vary at different levels of anthropomorphization**. Notably, this research was largely inspired by previous research from the paper [Promises and trust in humanâ€“robot interaction](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-88622-9) (Cominelli et. al, 2021).

**Results:** Results and findings are detailed in the following report, which was submitted for grading. 

Additionally, this project was awarded a distinction, scoring highly for being well-written and appropriate experimental design.
