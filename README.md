# ChatGPT Prisoner's Dilemma Experiment.
 
In this repository, you will find code used to implement an experiment involving human participants playing (Iterated) Prisoner's Dilemma with a computer that is anthropomorphized at different levels. The overall aim of the experiment was to investigate how cooperation between the player and the computer varies at different levels of anthropomorphization.

We hope this repository will be a useful resource for anyone interested in replicating or building upon our work. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to contact us.
